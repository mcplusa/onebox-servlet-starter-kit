<h3>Sample Directory OneBox Module Usage</h3>
<p>
Check out <a href="src/EmployeeDirectory.java">EmployeeDirectory.java</a> for the entire directory 
of people that you can query for in the sample organization.
</p>
<p>
If you are running the default sample OneBox provider (<a href="src/SampleNoAuthOneBoxProvider.java">SampleNoAuthOneBoxProvider.java</a>) which requires no authorization, then you should be able to query the directory and get detailed contact information for anyone in the organization.  Here is a sample search to exercise your OneBox.
</p>
<p>
<table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#c6c6c6">
<th><i>Search term</i></th>
<th><i>Expect to see</i></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap="true"><b>directory Brown</b></td>
<td>This will query the directory and return detailed contact information for all three people in the organization whose last name is Brown.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you are running one of the sample secure OneBox providers (<a href="src/SampleBasicAuthOneBoxProvider.java">SampleBasicAuthOneBoxProvider.java</a>,
<a href="src/SampleLDAPAuthOneBoxProvider.java">SampleLDAPAuthOneBoxProvider.java</a>, or 
<a href="src/SampleSSOAuthOneBoxProvider.java">SampleSSOAuthOneBoxProvider.java</a>) then see the provider source file for the user ids, roles, and passwords (if applicable) for the full set of users that you can authenticate as.
</p>
<p>
Here are some sample searches to exercise the SampleBasicAuthOneBoxProvider (or the other secure providers) and see the effect of user level access control in OneBox.  Assuming you are using a Google Search Appliance as your OneBox client and you are using the appliance's default user interface, you'll need to select "public and secure content" before running each search.  You'll also need to clear your browser cache (or restart your browser) in between search attempts to retain the ability to log in as a different user on each attempt.
