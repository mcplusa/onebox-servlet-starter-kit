<H2>ACME Employee Directory</H2>
<p>
This page represents an entry point for a web-based interface to our sample employee directory management application.  In a real situation the application would do its own access control and provide viewing and potentially data manipulation opportunities for the user.  It may be useful for the OneBox provider to pass contextual information such as the user's query and the user's identity information to the application (e.g. through the URL's querystring).
